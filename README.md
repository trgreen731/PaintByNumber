The main program is contained within the Completed.py file so run it from any command prompt to begin the program.
Note: The file path should be changed within the Completed.py file before use to fit your file path.

The program will ask for the name of the file (include the file type extension).
The program will ask for the maximum number of cells to include (the total cell are often reduced significantly below this number).
The program will ask for the number of colors to use.

Once all of these requests are completed, the program will run. It is not a completely optimized program and thus takes some time. The RBG color values of the colors used in the final image will be printed to the command prompt in order. A painted version and a unpainted version of the final image will be saved to your file system.
